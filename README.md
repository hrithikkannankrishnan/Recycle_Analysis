# Recycle_Analysis
Evaluates recycling-behavior interventions at NUS (shaped openings, banners) across materials and locations using DiD, ITS, and bootstrap robustness. Finds mixed/mostly null effects, plastic as priority contaminant, UTOWN as hotspot, and offers design- and ops-focused playbooks for action.
